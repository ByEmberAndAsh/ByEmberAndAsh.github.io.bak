title: Paratroopers of the Astral Legions of Kerrix
description: The warlords of Kerrix ran out of other people on Kerrix to conquer. They lacked access to any eldritch portals. They got lost in the non-euclidean geometries of the Labyrinth. They couldnâ€™t quite figure out how to make a golden sail. They are, however, the best damn fallers in the galaxy, good enough to fall through the layers of space and wage war on alien soil. Maybe you got left behind when the warlords moved on. Maybe you deserted. Maybe your astral plunge was too fast or too slow. Maybe you just wanted to stay. Maybe. Maybe not. Which way is home? A background for Troika! published by the Melsonian Arts Council.
