title: Little Gods
description: Little Gods is a tabletop role-playing game where one person is on a quest, and the remaining players are the little gods of the world, intent on meddling for their own ends. Little Gods is a game for three to seven players, total. One player takes on the role of a mortal creature on a quest. (Figure out among yourselves who that is going to be.) Everyone else takes on the role of a minor deity, the eponymous little gods. In terms of stuff, you need a piece of paper and a pencil, a small bag, and two tokens per player - one light, one dark. Itâ€™s important that these tokens be as physically similar as possible, except in color.
